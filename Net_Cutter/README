This folder contains a Python3.x program implementation of a net-cutter program. The program can be executed only AFTER the attacker has successfully become the MITM (Man
In The Middle). The program works by dropping all packets it receives from the target (actually intended for the router). Thus, the target, although connected to the 
internet, will be unable to access the internet.
