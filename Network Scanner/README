This folder contains a Python3.x implementation of a network scanner. The program works by sending ARP packets to all IP addresses within the network. If an ARP reply 
is received, the devices IP address and MAC address is recorded. If no ARP reply has been received, the IP address is ignored. Kindly note that the program takes a 
considerable amount of time. This makes the program extremely disadvantageous when compared to readily available network scanners (eg:nmap). Furthermore, applications 
like "zenmap" can even show the user the make and model of the devices connected to the internet. This cannot be achieved by the given implementation.
