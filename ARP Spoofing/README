This folder contains a Python3.x implementation of an ARP spoofer. An ARP Spoofer is a program that works to corrupt the ARP table. This is generally done as a first 
step in a MITM (Man-In-The-Middle) attack. The program continually updates the target's MAC address as the hacker's address in the routers ARP table and updates the
routers MAC address as the hacker's MAC address in the targets ARP table. Thus, the hacker becomes the middle man in the network and all packets pass through the 
hacker's computer.
